<p>The last couple of weeks have been quite busy, working towards the launch of a project I have been a part of for almost 1 1/2 year now (more on this after the lauch). Most of my spare time though has been spent trying to learn kitesurfing, and here are some pictures of the places we went and the things we saw during june and july.</p>

<p class="description">Yep… we actually saw a tornado which is something you usually don’t come across in Denmark.</p>

<p class="description">Waking up in a cornfield is soooo much better than a tent – I have to do this more often!</p>
